Topic 1: Introduction to Python

In this topic, we will introduce you to Python, a popular and versatile programming language. Python is easy to learn and widely used in various fields, from web development to data science.

Items covered:

   ## What is Python?
        Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
        It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

   ## Why use Python?
        Python has a clear and concise syntax that makes it easy for beginners to understand.
        It has a large community and extensive libraries, making it suitable for various tasks.
        Python is cross-platform, meaning it can run on different operating systems.

   ## Installing Python:
        You can download and install Python from the official website (www.python.org).
        Choose the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).

   ## Your First Python Program:
        We'll guide you through writing your first Python program: "Hello, World!"
        This program will display the text "Hello, World!" on the screen.

   ## Running Python Code:
        You can run Python code interactively in the Python shell or create script files (.py) and execute them from the command line.

   ## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):
        IDEs like PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, and IDLE provide a more convenient environment for coding in Python.

   ## Basic Syntax:
        Python code is structured with proper indentation (spaces or tabs).
        End-of-line statements are not required; Python uses line breaks to separate code blocks.

    ## Commenting in Python:
        Comments help you explain your code and are ignored during execution.
        Use the "#" symbol to indicate comments.

    ## Understanding Variables:
        Variables are used to store data and can hold different data types (e.g., numbers, strings).
        You don't need to declare a variable's type explicitly in Python.

    ## Printing Output:
        The "print()" function allows you to display output to the console.
        You can print variables or text enclosed in quotes.

    # Example:

    Hello world code:

    ### This is a comment in Python. Comments are used to explain code and are ignored during execution.
        # Print "Hello, World!" to the console
        print("Hello, World!")
        
        # Printing variables
        name = "John"
        age = 25
        print("My name is", name, "and I am", age, "years old.")
        
        # Basic arithmetic operation
        a = 10
        b = 5
        result = a + b
        print("The result of", a, "+", b, "is", result)
        
        # This is another comment
        
        # Multi-line comment
        """
        Python supports multi-line comments using triple quotes.
        These comments can span multiple lines.
        """
        
        # End of the program
        print("End of the program")

    ### Execute program 
        Execute: To run the Python script, type the following command in the terminal: python hello.py
    ### Output
      Hello, World!
      My name is John and I am 25 years old.
      The result of 10 + 5 is 15
      End of the program
